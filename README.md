Halo orbit solver with modern Fortran

## Description

An application that can be used to generate long-duration Earth-Moon halo orbits in the ephemeris model. A work in progress.

## Build

The application is built using the [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) (FPM). FPM will download all the required dependencies and compile the program, and can also be used to run the tests.

```
fpm build --profile release
```

To run an example:

```
fpm run --profile release -- examples/example2.json
```

OpenMP can also be employed to speed up the process.
Another example, using the Intel Fortran Compiler with OpenMP:

```
fpm run --profile release --compiler ifort --flag "-O2 -qopenmp" -- examples/example.json
```

### Building On Windows

Work in progress....

Example:

```
"<intel install dir>\windows\bin\ifortvars.bat" intel64
"<intel install dir>\windows\mkl\bin\mklvars.bat" intel64

set OMP_NUM_THREADS=12

fpm run --profile release --compiler ifort --flag "/fpp /Qmkl:parallel /Qopenmp" -- examples/example.json
```

Result is:
```
LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'lapack.lib'
```

It's because `fmin` and `nlsolver-fortran` both have explicit `lapack` and `blas` dependencies specified in their `fpm.toml` files (`link = ["lapack", "blas"]`). If i delete those it compiles.

Also: it seems like `FIRSTPRIVATE(me)` is causing random crashes on Windows. Removing that seems to make it work consistently.
